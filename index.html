              <p>
                I help people who've tried everything—therapy, meditation, vision boards,
                affirmations—and still feel like something invisible is blocking them.
              </p>
              <p>
                For 18 years, one obsession has kept me going:
                <strong>why do some people get the life they want while others stay
                  stuck, no matter how hard they work on themselves?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The answer has nothing to do with "positive thinking" or forcing yourself
                to visualise harder. It's about <strong>coherence</strong>:
                when the body, emotions and thoughts finally say the same thing,
                reality starts to shift.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a BSc in Psychology and am a member of the British Psychological Society.
                I trained for six years in body psychotherapy in the UK, coaching in Poland,
                Peak State Trauma Therapy in the United States, and completed 500-hour yoga
                teacher training in India.
              </p>
              <p>
                For years I've been integrating Western psychology, body-based work and
                contemplative practices into a single system.
                <strong>The Code of Reality</strong> is the book I needed 18 years ago—
                when nothing worked and it was clear the problem wasn’t that I “didn’t believe enough”.

                <div class="author-side-caption">
                  After <em>Millionaire Mind Intensive</em> with T. Harv Eker — one of the trainings
                  that shaped how I think about identity, wealth and what’s actually possible.
                </div>
              </div>

              <p>
                I went through every training I could find. I kept investing in myself and still
                wasn't "enough"—not spiritual enough, loving enough, successful enough, you name it.
                Silent retreats, hypnosis, therapy, coaching, endless courses… and underneath it all,
                a quiet belief that something in me was fundamentally broken.
              </p>
              <p>
                I didn’t give up. Over time I saw that every approach had fundamental holes.
                Psychotherapy often focuses on deficits and forgets about resources.
                Coaching squeezes your strengths like a lemon without respecting your limits.
                "Alignment" is thrown around everywhere, but almost nobody can explain
                <em>how</em> to become aligned in a way your body actually understands.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually I realised each method was only holding one piece of the puzzle.
                The real power is in <strong>integrating</strong> them into one coherent process.
                That’s what <strong>The Code of Reality</strong> finally does.

          <p class="system-desc">
            Before you "attract" anything, you need to know <em>who</em> the person is
            who already has it. This isn't fantasy—it's discovering the version of you
            that trauma and life circumstances covered up. When your identity becomes clear —
            “I am the person who…” — your brain, nervous system and decisions start aligning
            with that version.

            You can repeat “I am abundant” all day.
            If the body is still in survival mode, the body wins.
            Congruence is the moment when thoughts, emotions and the nervous system say
            the same thing. That’s why affirmations are too weak—they only touch the mind.
            When congruence appears, you stop fighting yourself and energy stops leaking
            into self-sabotage.

          <p class="system-desc">
            Full manifestation is a paradox: you ask for something you don't yet have,
            but you must first become the person who already has it.
            Not “I want to be wealthy,” but “I am the person who creates wealth”—
            and your body feels it. The same principle psychology uses for identity-based
            habits—just applied to manifestation.

          <h3 class="system-heading">Action</h3>
          <p class="system-desc">
            When identity, intention and state are aligned, action stops being
            forced effort. Movement becomes a natural expression of who you are,
            not an attempt to prove your worth.
            This isn't about sitting on the couch “sending vibrations” —
            it's about acting from calm certainty, without gripping the steering wheel in panic.
